A novel idea that was conceptualized by the team, in the AI Times players are presented with a random image and asked to provide a short caption. The generative AI is then prompted to create a tabloid style front page including headline and tag line. The players then vote on their favorite story to choose a winner. The combination of abstract, quirky images and the imagination of the players results in some really wonderfully silly front pages.
